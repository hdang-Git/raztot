Additional Installation Notes

 
JANUS
Janus Issues during ./setup.sh
https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway 
Follow directions in this link.

1. Install libraries just to be sure since libnice is the issue
sudo apt install install libmicrohttpd-dev libjansson-dev \
	libssl-dev libsrtp-dev libsofia-sip-ua-dev libglib2.0-dev \
	libopus-dev libogg-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev liblua5.3-dev \
	libconfig-dev pkg-config gengetopt libtool automake

  
2. First error is libnice so you have to clone from source and build libnice yourself
    	a. download meson: https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html 
	follow guide to get meson and ninja 
		
		pip3 install --user meson

	b. clone libnice and build in a directory separate and above this
	git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libnice/libnice
	cd libnice
	meson --prefix=/usr build && ninja -C build && sudo ninja -C build install 


3. Second error: configure: error: libsrtp and libsrtp2 not found. See README.md for installation instructions
 	where libsrtp-2.2.0 is missing and setup fails so must be manually added
	a. run the following command in a separate folder not in raztot like libnice
		wget https://github.com/cisco/libsrtp/archive/v2.2.0.tar.gz
		tar xfv v2.2.0.tar.gz
		cd libsrtp-2.2.0
		./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-openssl
		make shared_library && sudo make install
